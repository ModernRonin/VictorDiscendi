# Background

I am learning a new foreign language and all the existing tools for vocabulary building/training on a mobile phone do not fulfill what I want.
In particular, none of them uses reasonable heuristics for picking which word-pairs need to be trained most.

At the same time, I want to start using F# for something more than just toy projects.

Thus, LanguageTraining was born.
